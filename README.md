# 440-Tuner
A minimalist themed violin tuner for desktop. A440, also known as concert A, has a frequency of 440 Hertz so I decided the name 440 Tuner would be appropriate for this application as one could translate the name to 'A Tuner'. This is a personal project that is in progress. I started this on December 30, 2018. As of now I have a very basic GUI applet created and am currently in my research phase. Upon completetion of this project, my aim is to recreate this application for Android.
